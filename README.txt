How my Program is Compiled (Interpreted since it is in Python):

1) Open Visual Studio code

2) Make sure the Python is installed
    Check this in the terminal by running the command python --version

3) Use the python command with the following arguments to test for both of my created used
    python access.py testcase1.txt
    python access.py testcase2.txt

    (access.py is the main/top-level file with the MyFacebook class which handles the access control by importing
    management classes for friends, lists, and pictures, in addition to logging information to audit.txt)
