## ðŸ§ª STS-CSSP-Capstone Testing Strategy

This document defines the goal of writing tests, what tests will be written, and when tests will be written, as well as the testing environment and procedures.

---

### **Goal of Writing Tests**

The goal of writing tests is to ensure that the application is working the way it is intended to. This is to catch any issues early in the development process and before deploying any changes to production.

* **Test Type:** **Feature tests** are the main tests that will be written, which verify user interaction is functioning properly.
* **Basis:** These tests will be written according to software requirements and design documentation.
* **Schedule:** Tests will be written **asynchronously**, preferably before development takes place but also retroactively if need be.

---

### **Testing Environment**

This section defines how to set up an environment to run tests.

1.  **Git**
    * Installation command: `sudo apt install git`
2.  **Docker Engine**
    * Installation commands:
        ```bash
        curl -fsSL [https://get.docker.com-o](https://get.docker.com-o) get-docker.sh
        sudo sh get-docker.sh
        ```
    * **Note:** `Curl` is required if you use the code above to install Docker Engine. You can install it using the command `sudo apt install curl`.

---

### **Testing Procedure**

This defines how tests will be run.

#### **Local Testing**
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Checkout the main branch.
3.  Cd to the project root directory.
4.  Start the rails server (e.g., `rails server`).
5.  Run tests:
    * Run all tests: (e.g., `rspec`)
    * Run **free** tests: (e.g., `rspec spec/features/free`)
    * Run **not free** tests: (e.g., `rspec spec/features/not_free`)

#### **Docker Testing**
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Checkout the main branch.
3.  Build the Docker testing container (e.g., `docker build -t "cssp_test".`).
    * *The example above assumes the Dockerfile is named Dockerfile and the path is the project directory*.
    * *It also assumes the user has been added to the Docker group*. If not, you can prepend Docker commands with `sudo`.
4.  Run the Docker testing container (e.g., `docker run -t "cssp_test"`).
    * The `ENTRYPOINT` to the Docker container automatically runs all tests. The results of running all the tests will then be displayed in the terminal.

---

### **Testing Schedule**

This defines when and what tests will be run.

* All tests will be run when a **commit is made** to the repository, helping developers to quickly see if their code changes break anything.
* All tests will also be run when a **pull request is made**, ensuring good code quality on the main branch.
* If tests fail on a pull request, a follow-up commit can be made to fix any issues.
* Once all tests pass, the pull request will automatically be merged into the main branch.

---

### **Test List**

A list of all current tests.

#### **Free Tests**

A list of all tests that **do not cost money** to run (i.e., tests don't make calls to the AWS API).
